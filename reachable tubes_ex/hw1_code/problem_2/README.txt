TASK: You need to compute the BRT and the optimal controller for a human model.
Specifially, you are required to fill in the files:
    1. main.m
    You need to define the grid and the target function for the computation.

    2. @Human/optCtrl.m
    You need to compute the optimal controller depending on whether it is 
    trying to minimize or maximize the value function.
